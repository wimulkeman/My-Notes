Training a model to locate a object
===================================

## 1. Train a object classifier

## 2. Scan a image with a sliding window
- [Sliding Windows for Object Detection with Python and OpenCV](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/23/sliding-windows-for-object-detection-with-python-and-opencv/)

## 3. (optional) Use image pyramids to get the ideal image scale
- [Image Pyramids with Python and OpenCV](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/16/image-pyramids-with-python-and-opencv/)

## 4. Get the coordinates of the object within a image

## 5. Use the gathered coordinates to train a object location predictor
