Training a model to locate a object
===================================

## 1. Train a object classifier
See the "Training the model" note. That one is for Tensor Flow.

## 2. Scan a image with a sliding window

## 3. (optional) Use image pyramids to get the ideal image scale

## 4. Get the coordinates of the object within a image

## 5. Use the gathered coordinates to train a object location predictor
